/*Filter and Sort Data from a List
Challenge: Write a function that takes a list of movies (with fields like Title, Genre, and Year)
and returns a filtered list based on genre and sorted by release year.
Skills Tested: Filtering and sorting, slice manipulation.
Hints: Use Goâ€™s built-in sort package for sorting.*/
